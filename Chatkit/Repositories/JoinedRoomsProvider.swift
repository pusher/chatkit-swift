/// A provider which exposes a collection of all rooms joined by the user.
///
/// Construct an instance of this class using `Chatkit.createJoinedRoomsProvider(...)`
///
/// ## What is provided
///
/// The provider exposes a set, `rooms: Set<Room>` which presents the rooms that the current user is a member of.
///
/// ## Receiving live updates
///
/// In order to be notified when the contents of the `rooms` changes, implement the `JoinedRoomsProviderDelegate` protocol and assign the `JoinedRoomsProvider.delegate` property.
///
/// Note that when the provider is first returned to you, it will already be populated, and the delegate will only be invoked when the contents change.
///
/// ## Understanding the `state` of the provider
///
/// The `state` property describes the state of the live update connection, either
///   - `.connected`: updates are flowing live, or
///   - `.degraded`: updates may be delayed due to network problems.
///
