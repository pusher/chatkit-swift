///
/// Construct an instance of this class using `Chatkit.createJoinedRoomsViewModel(...)`
///
/// This class is intended to be bound to a UICollectionView or UITableView.
///
/// ## What is provided
///
/// The ViewModel exposes an array, `rooms: [Room]` which presents the rooms that the current user is a member
/// of in descending order of the time of their last message, or their creation time if they contain no messages.
///
/// Each item in the `rooms` array can be used to populate a cell in a `UITableView` or `UICollectionView`.
///
/// ## Receiving live updates
///
/// In order to be notified when the contents of the `rooms` changes, implement the `JoinedRoomsViewModelDelegate` protocol and assign the `JoinedRoomsViewModel.delegate` property.
///
/// Note that when the view model is first returned to you, it will already be populated, and the delegate will only be invoked when the contents change.
///
/// ## Understanding the `state` of the ViewModel
///
/// The `state` property describes the state of the live update connection, either
///   - `.connected`: updates are flowing live, or
///   - `.degraded`: updates may be delayed due to network problems.
