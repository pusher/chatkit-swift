## Building and Running

### Minimum Requirements

* [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) - The easiest way to get Xcode is from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), but you can also download it from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) if you have an AppleID registered with an Apple Developer account.

* Swift version 4.1 and above

* iOS version 10.0

Before building & running in Xcode, install all of the required dependencies with [Carthage](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-tutorial-ios#carthage) or [CocoaPods](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-tutorial-ios#cocoapods).

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Chatkit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

# Replace `<Your Target Name>` with your app's target name.
target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'PusherChatkit'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

> You might need to use the `--repo-update` flag to ensure the specs repository is aware of the latest version of PusherChatkit.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Chatkit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "pusher/chatkit-swift"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `PusherChatkit.framework` and `PusherPlatform.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Getting started

Head over to [our documentation](https://docs.pusher.com/chatkit/reference/swift).

## Running tests

Some of the tests require a valid Chatkit instance locator, key, and token provider URL.

To set this up, run the following command:

```bash
cp Tests/Config/TestConfigExample.swift Tests/Config/TestConfig.swift
```

Then edit `Tests/Config/TestConfig.swift` to include a valid Chatkit instance locator, key, and token provider URL.
